***Assistive technologies*** are tools, devices, or software designed to help people with disabilities perform tasks that might be challenging or impossible for them otherwise. These technologies aim to enhance the independence, productivity, and quality of life of individuals with disabilities. Here are some common types of assistive technologies:

1. **Screen Readers:** Software that reads aloud text displayed on a computer screen. It is crucial for individuals with visual impairments.

2. **Braille Displays:** Devices that convert digital text into Braille, allowing people with visual impairments to read content through touch.

3. **Magnification Software:** Tools that enlarge on-screen content for individuals with low vision.

4. **Speech Recognition Software:** Software that translates spoken words into text, enabling individuals with mobility impairments to control computers using voice commands.

5. **Alternative Keyboards and Mice:** Keyboards and mice designed with larger buttons, touch-sensitive surfaces, or alternative input methods to accommodate individuals with motor impairments.

6. **Text-to-Speech Software:** Software that converts written text into spoken words, aiding individuals with dyslexia or reading difficulties.

7. **Closed Captioning and Subtitles:** Text displayed on a screen that provides a transcript of spoken dialogue and describes relevant sounds for individuals with hearing impairments.

8. **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices:** Tools that help individuals with communication disorders express themselves, often through symbols, pictures, or text-to-speech.

9. **Adaptive Learning Software:** Educational software tailored to the needs of individuals with learning disabilities, providing customized learning experiences.

These technologies play a crucial role in creating an inclusive digital environment and breaking down barriers for people with disabilities. They empower individuals to access information, communicate, and engage with the world in ways that suit their abilities and preferences.
