### `aria-label` Summary:

- **Purpose:** `aria-label` is used to provide a text label for an element when there is no visible label, making it accessible for users of assistive technologies.

- **Usage:** Assign a value to `aria-label` that succinctly describes the purpose or action associated with the element.

- **Example:**
  ```html
  <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
  ```
  In this example, the button is labeled "Close," indicating that clicking it will perform a closing action.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use `aria-label` when an element lacks visible text and its purpose needs to be communicated.
  - Keep the label descriptive and concise.
  - Avoid redundant use on elements already containing visible text unless additional clarification is needed.

- **Testing:** Verify the effectiveness of `aria-label` by testing your application with screen readers to ensure that the intended information is conveyed.

Using `aria-label` appropriately enhances the accessibility of your web content for all users.
