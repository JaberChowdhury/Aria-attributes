Let's move on to the `aria-hidden` attribute.

### `aria-hidden`

The `aria-hidden` attribute is used to indicate whether an element should be visible or hidden to assistive technologies.

#### Example:

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">This content is hidden</div>
```

In this example, the content within the `<div>` is hidden from assistive technologies because `aria-hidden` is set to "true."

#### Best Practices:

1. Use `aria-hidden="true"` on elements that you want to hide from assistive technologies.

2. Setting `aria-hidden="true"` will remove the element and its children from the accessibility tree, making it effectively invisible to screen readers.

3. This attribute is often used in conjunction with dynamically shown or hidden content to ensure that hidden content is not announced to screen reader users when it's not relevant.

4. If an element is visually hidden but should still be announced by screen readers, prefer CSS techniques like `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` over `aria-hidden`.

### Use Case:

Imagine you have a pop-up modal on your webpage, and you want to hide it from screen readers when it's not visible:

```html
<div id="modal" aria-hidden="true">
  <!-- Modal content goes here -->
</div>
```

When the modal is hidden, setting `aria-hidden="true"` ensures that screen readers won't announce its content. When the modal is visible, you can dynamically update `aria-hidden` to "false" to make it accessible.

This attribute is a useful tool for managing visibility in a way that aligns with accessibility best practices.
