Let's discuss the `role` attribute in conjunction with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

### `role`

The `role` attribute is used to define the purpose or type of a user interface element, especially when the native HTML semantics are not sufficient. It helps assistive technologies understand the intended meaning of an element.

#### Example:

```html
<button role="link" onclick="window.location.href='/home'">
  Go to Home
</button>
```

In this example, the `role="link"` is used to indicate that the button functions like a link, even though it's implemented as a button.

#### Best Practices:

1. Use native HTML elements with appropriate semantics whenever possible. Only use `role` when necessary.

2. Choose the most suitable `role` value for the element's purpose.

3. Avoid using `role` to change the inherent meaning of standard HTML elements.

### Use Case:

Consider a custom-designed interactive element:

```html
<div role="slider" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" aria-valuenow="50">
  <!-- Slider content goes here -->
</div>
```

In this case, the `role="slider"` is used to convey to assistive technologies that the div element represents a slider, and the `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` attributes provide information about the slider's value range and current value.
